## Track changes

A shell script to produce track-changes file for paper submission.

Generate track-changes from old and new tex-file archives (`.zip` files). 

For example, the archives (`.zip`) could be downloaded from Overleaf based on label versions

Currently, the names of old and new tex files (in `.zip` files) that have changes should be the same and self-defined.
